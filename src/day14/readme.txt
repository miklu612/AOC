I honestly don't have a clue how this was supposed to be figured out without
just manually checking possibilities, so I have split the answers into two files
that each do one part. The second part you have to do manually, since I only
have one case where the tree exists, so I cannot write an algorithm that will
find the tree in every permutation.
